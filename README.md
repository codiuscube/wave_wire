# Home Break

A lightweight, "invisible" surf alert system that notifies you only when conditions match your definition of fun.

## Vision

Home Break solves the problem of noise and clutter in existing surf apps. Instead of providing passive charts or overwhelming feeds, it runs in the background and proactively notifies users only when conditions match their specific definition of "fun."

It combines hard data (Open-Meteo, NOAA) with a "Personality Engine" (AI) to deliver alerts that feel like a text from a local buddy.

## Features

- **Invisible by Design** - Runs in the background, no constant checking required
- **Personalized Alerts** - Define your own conditions for what makes a "fun" session
- **Smart Notifications** - AI-powered personality engine delivers alerts like a friend would
- **Real Data Sources** - Powered by Open-Meteo and NOAA for accurate surf conditions
